% Parameters

d_per = 20; % Persistence distance (max. distance to nearest neighbor as leader)
t_per = 700; % Persistence time (max. time as leader)
t_ref = 800; % Refractory time (min. time as follower before becoming leader)
t_del = 0.1; % Delay time (reaction time in velocity delay diff. eq.)
C_ali = 3; % Alignment coefficient

% Parameters for obstacle

% Initial conditions

    %% Update variables
